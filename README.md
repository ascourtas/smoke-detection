This is the HPWREN Fire Ignition image Library (FIgLib), based on images from fixed cameras at HPWREN sites. 
The primary purpose is the creation of data sets for 40 minutes before and after fire ignitions for neural network training. 
For illustration purposes video animations are included as well. The image file names are:
